title: GitHub Action inputs and outputs
---

DocsPress is a Node 20 GitHub Action configured entirely through `with` inputs.

## Synchronization mode

| Input | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mode` | `publish` | `publish` sends Markdown to WordPress, `propose` opens a Markdown pull request from WordPress edits, and `reconcile` safely handles both directions. |

## WordPress connection

| Input | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `wordpress-url` | `https://public-api.wordpress.com` | API base. For self-hosted WordPress, use the site origin without `/wp-json`. |
| `wordpress-site` | required | WordPress.com site ID or domain. Action metadata requires it for every run. |
| `wordpress-access-token` | required | Bearer token permitted to edit Pages. Use the `WP_ACCESS_TOKEN` GitHub Actions secret. |

## Documentation discovery and routing

| Input | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docs-dir` | `docs` | Directory containing `.md` and `.markdown` files. |
| `manifest-file` | empty | Optional JSON manifest for explicit titles, slugs, parents, and source files. |
| `redirects-file` | empty | Optional JSON redirects map that creates managed moved-page placeholders. |
| `versions-file` | empty | Optional ordered API-version registry. Enables root, directory, suffix, and per-version manifest sources through DocsPress Blocks. |
| `root-slug` | `docs` | Slug of the managed root Page. |
| `root-title` | `Docs` | Fallback root title when no root document supplies one. |
| `managed-path` | `root-slug` | Page path this repository owns, for example `docs/my-plugin`. Limits deletions and reconciliation to that subtree so several repositories can publish below one shared parent Page. Must be the root path or a path below it. |

## Content conversion and source links

| Input | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `create-h1` | `false` | Adds the Page title as an H1 Gutenberg block. Keep false with the DocsPress theme. |
| `rewrite-links` | `true` | Rewrites known local Markdown targets to their WordPress routes. |
| `edit-link` | `false` | Appends a source link to Markdown-backed Pages. |
| `edit-link-text` | `Edit this page on GitHub` | Text for the appended source link. |
| `github-repository` | `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` | Repository used in edit URLs, for example `owner/repo`. |
| `github-ref` | `GITHUB_REF_NAME`, then `main` | Branch or ref used in edit URLs. |
| `github-server-url` | `GITHUB_SERVER_URL`, then `https://github.com` | GitHub server used in edit URLs. |

## WordPress-to-GitHub pull requests

| Input | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `github-token` | `github.token` | Token used to create commits, the managed branch, and pull requests. |
| `pull-request-base` | repository default branch | Base branch for the rolling pull request. |
| `pull-request-branch` | `docspress/wordpress-sync` | Action-owned branch that is refreshed from the latest base on every run. |
| `pull-request-title` | generated | Optional pull request and commit title override. The generated title follows Conventional Commits, for example `docs(sync-and-rest-api): sync changes from WordPress`. |

Reverse sync requires `contents: write` and `pull-requests: write`. The repository must also allow GitHub Actions to create pull requests, or `github-token` must use a suitable GitHub App or personal access token. Follow the [continuous synchronization guide](../guides/continuous-sync.md#stage-4-reconcile-wordpress-edits) to enable the repository setting.

## Publication and deletion

| Input | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `status` | `publish` | WordPress status for created or updated Pages. Start with `draft`. |
| `delete-mode` | `trash` | `trash` moves removed managed Pages to Trash; `force` permanently deletes them. |
| `dry-run` | `false` | Plans operations without WordPress or GitHub writes. Start with `true`. |
