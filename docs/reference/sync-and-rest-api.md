title: Synchronization and REST API

DocsPress builds a desired Page model from Markdown, lists existing WordPress Pages, and reconciles only the Pages carrying a valid management sentinel.

## WordPress endpoints

For WordPress.com, the Pages collection is:

```text
https://public-api.wordpress.com/wp/v2/sites/{site}/pages
```

For self-hosted WordPress, it is:

```text
{wordpress-url}/wp-json/wp/v2/pages
```

Listing requests use `context=edit`, `status=any`, and pages of 100 records until `x-wp-totalpages` is exhausted.

Updates use `POST /pages/{id}`. Deletions use `DELETE /pages/{id}` and add `force=true` only for `delete-mode: force`.

## Management sentinel

Every generated Page starts with a record containing version, Page key, source path, and content hash. By default it is a locked `docspress/sentinel` block:

```html
<!-- wp:docspress/sentinel {"lock":{"move":true,"remove":true},"sentinel":{"version":1,"key":"docs/getting-started","source":"docs/getting-started.md","hash":"…"}} /-->
```

The hash covers the Page key, source, title, slug, parent key, status, and converted body. A content, route, hierarchy, source, or status change therefore schedules an update.

The whole record lives in one `sentinel` attribute rather than one attribute per key. The Action adds keys to it — the documentation version, the sidebar identity, a base64 copy of the source Markdown — and the block editor discards any attribute a block did not register, so a record spread across separate attributes would lose those keys the first time an author saved the Page. A lost hash makes the Page unmanageable.

The block renders nothing on the front end. In the editor it appears as a one-line placeholder naming the source file, with a **View record** button that opens the record and the Markdown behind it. It is locked against removal and hidden from the inserter: deleting it disconnects the Page from its source, and the next run then reports an unmanaged Page on a managed path rather than publishing.

Rendering the placeholder needs the DocsPress Blocks plugin. Set [`sentinel-format`](action-inputs.md) to `comment` on a site that does not run it, and the Action writes the original bare HTML comment instead:

```html
<!-- docspress:{"version":1,"key":"docs/getting-started","source":"docs/getting-started.md","hash":"…"} -->
```

WordPress has no block for a bare comment, so it collects that record into a freeform block: the editor shows a Classic block whose body is the raw JSON, and converting that Classic block to blocks turns the record into a visible paragraph and destroys it. Both spellings are read, so Pages published before the block existed keep working; the first run after the switch rewrites each one.

In `propose` and `reconcile` modes, the same hash acts as a common ancestor. DocsPress computes the current GitHub and live WordPress states against that ancestor before it performs any write.

## Reconciliation order

Desired Pages are sorted by depth and key so parents are available before children. Existing Pages are indexed by their full parent path and by sentinel key.

| Condition | Operation |
| --- | --- |
| No Page at the desired path | Create |
| Managed Page with changed hash or parent | Update |
| Managed Page with matching hash and parent | Unchanged |
| Unmanaged Page already using the path | Conflict; do not write |
| Managed Page below `root-slug` absent from desired docs | Trash or permanently delete |
| Desired child whose parent is unavailable | Conflict |

For bidirectional runs, a GitHub-only change is published, a WordPress-only title or content change becomes a pull request, and matching current states refresh the sentinel after that pull request merges. If both current states differ from the sentinel and from each other, the run fails before writes. WordPress-created or deleted Pages and WordPress slug, parent, or status changes are intentionally outside reverse-sync scope.

## Dry-run behavior

Dry-run performs discovery, conversion, Page listing, comparison, conflict detection, deletion planning, and reverse Markdown generation. It assigns synthetic parent IDs for planned creates but does not call WordPress or GitHub write endpoints.

## API errors

DocsPress surfaces the WordPress error message. When WordPress.com reports that `global` scope is required, the error adds a hint to regenerate `WP_ACCESS_TOKEN` with the token helper.
