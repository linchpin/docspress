title: Structure pages and routes

DocsPress derives the WordPress Page hierarchy from Markdown paths unless a manifest defines a different contract.

## File-to-Page mapping

<!-- docspress:block
{
  "version": 1,
  "name": "docspress/file-tree",
  "attrs": {
    "root": "docs/",
    "tree": "index.md\ngetting-started.md\nguides/\n  index.md\n  continuous-sync.md\nreference/\n  action-inputs.md",
    "caption": "Index files become section roots; other filenames become child slugs."
  }
}
-->
#### docs/

```text
index.md
getting-started.md
guides/
  index.md
  continuous-sync.md
reference/
  action-inputs.md
```

_Index files become section roots; other filenames become child slugs._
<!-- /docspress:block -->

With `root-slug: docs`, these files map to:

| Source | WordPress path |
| --- | --- |
| `docs/index.md` | `/docs/` |
| `docs/getting-started.md` | `/docs/getting-started/` |
| `docs/guides/index.md` | `/docs/guides/` |
| `docs/guides/continuous-sync.md` | `/docs/guides/continuous-sync/` |
| `docs/reference/action-inputs.md` | `/docs/reference/action-inputs/` |

Both `index.md` and `README.md` are treated as a folder index. Do not place both in the same directory: they normalize to the same route and DocsPress stops with an error.

When the DocsPress theme is active, every file-backed Page also exposes the exact source at the Page path with `.md` instead of the trailing slash. For example, `/docs/reference/action-inputs.md` returns the original Markdown and frontmatter. The theme lists these source endpoints in `/llms.txt`; generated placeholder Pages are omitted because they have no source file. See [Make documentation AI-friendly](../guides/ai-friendly-documentation.md) for the discovery and verification workflow.

## Titles and headings

Title precedence is:

1. frontmatter `title`;
2. the first Markdown `# H1`;
3. the filename converted to a title.

When the first H1 supplies the title, DocsPress removes it from the body. For the DocsPress theme, prefer:

```markdown
---
title: Continuous synchronization
---

One-sentence page outcome.

## First section
```

Use `create-h1: false` because the theme already renders the WordPress Page title.

## Sidebar position and initial state

The DocsPress theme reads two optional Docusaurus-style frontmatter fields:

```markdown
---
title: Continuous synchronization
sidebar_position: 20
sidebar_collapsed: true
---
```

- `sidebar_position` must be a signed integer. DocsPress synchronizes it to WordPress `menu_order`; the automatic Page tree honors it when **Page order, then title** is selected. Positions apply among siblings, with titles breaking ties.
- `sidebar_collapsed` must be `true` or `false`. It controls the initial state only when the Page has children in the rendered sidebar.
- Without `sidebar_collapsed`, inactive branches start collapsed. The current Page and all its ancestors remain visible regardless of their configured default.

A hand-built WordPress sidebar menu keeps its menu-item order, but Page-backed parent items still inherit `sidebar_collapsed`. Removing a previously synchronized `sidebar_position` resets that source-owned Page order to `0`; DocsPress leaves legacy manual Page order untouched when frontmatter never owned it. Invalid field values stop collection and identify the source file instead of publishing an ambiguous navigation state.

## Contextual sidebars

The automatic Page tree remains the default and needs no configuration. Larger sites can opt into a repository-level route map that gives API, extension, CLI, or other sections their own automatic navigation context.

Read [Use contextual sidebars](../guides/contextual-sidebars.md) for the complete configuration, route rules, migration behavior, and runnable WordPress Playground example.

## Missing parents

When a nested file has no section index, DocsPress creates a managed placeholder Page for the missing parent. Add a real `index.md` when that section needs useful introductory content.

## Local links

With `rewrite-links: true`, known relative or root-relative Markdown links become WordPress routes. External URLs, anchors, protocol URLs, and unknown files remain unchanged.

```markdown
[Publish existing docs](../publish-existing-docs/index.md)
[Action inputs](/docs/reference/action-inputs.md)
[WordPress](https://wordpress.org/)
```

## Edit links

The Action can append a source link to Markdown-backed Pages with `edit-link: true`. The DocsPress theme also provides its own two-button article action bar, built from the sentinel source path and the repository, ref, and server URL that each synchronization stores on the Page. When using the theme action bar, keep the Action-level edit link disabled to avoid a duplicate control.
